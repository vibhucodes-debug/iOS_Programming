ARCHITECTURE OF SWIFT 
---------------------

print("Hello, World!")  // 'print()' function outputs "Hello, World!" in the console/terminal.

Note : The angular brackets '>' are used to denote a line in a terminal, they are not a part of swift code.

How to write code?
1. A complete swift command is a statement. 
2. Write one statemet in one line
    Example - > print("Hello")  //  First line
              > print("World!)  //  Second line
3. If we combine more than one statement in a line, then we have to put a semicolon(;) between the 2 satements.
    Example - print("Hello, World!"); print("Hello, World")
4. Putting a semicolon(;)  at the end of each statement is not necessary.

--- COMMENTS ---
||||||||||||||||

1. Anything, written after //, or between /* */ is a comment, i.e the rest of the code is not effected by a comment. Programmers usually use comments to elaborate their code or to take notes.
  Example -  > print("Hello, World!) // This is a single line comment.
             > /*
             >  This is a multi-line comment
             > */

5. A single statement can be broken into multiple lines in order to prevent them from becoming long lines. This is for the purpose of neat and clean code.
  Example - 
            > // Complete statement in one line
            > for i in range{ print(i) } 
            >
            > // For loop statement in multiple lines
            > for i in range {
            >     print(i)
            > }

6. In most coding languages, curly braces are used as delimiters .i.e used for seperation. It is conventional to give a line break after curly braces and, put an indentation (spaces or tabs) for code clarity.
  Example - 
            > for i in range { // line breaks here
            > ---- print("Hello")  // Here, (----) before print() function represents indentation
            > }

7. XCode will automatically impose these conventions but a Swift code doesn't care about line breaks and indentations. For Swift the following code is also acceptable :
            > for i in range{ print(i) }

--- COMPILATION ---
|||||||||||||||||||

Swift is a compiled language. 

Code text file is firstly passed through a compiler, and then converted into a low-level language that the computer can understand.
A code must build before its actually run. The compiler checks for errors in the code and if it encounters any error a prompt is thrown to fix it before running the code.
